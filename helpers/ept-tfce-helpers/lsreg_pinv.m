function beta = lsreg_pinv(D,regs)
%
% GENERAL
% -------
% calculate least-squares regression using Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.
% dim 1 of data/regs should be subjects/observations, dim2 should be 
% variables 
%
% INPUTS
% ------
% D - matrix of data (DVs). n(subjects) X n(variables).
% regs - matrix of regressors (IVs). n(subjects) X n(variables)
%
% OUTPUT
% ------
% beta - matrix of beta weights resulting from least-squares fit
